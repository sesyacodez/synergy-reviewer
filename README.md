# Synergy Reviewer

An ensemble AI code review bot. Multiple independent AI models analyze your PR diffs in parallel, then a synthesizer cross-references their findings to eliminate bias and surface high-confidence issues.

## Demo

## Why Ensemble Review?

A single AI reviewer can be biased — it may hallucinate issues, miss real problems, or fixate on style over substance. Synergy Reviewer sends the same PR diff to **3 independent models** (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — defaults use free `:free` endpoints) for parallel analysis. When multiple models independently flag the same issue, confidence is high. When they disagree, the dispute is surfaced for human judgment.

1. Mention `@synergy-reviewer` in any PR comment (optionally with specific instructions)
2. The bot clones the PR branch, extracts the diff, and sends it to 3 AI models in parallel — each analyzes the diff independently
3. A synthesizer model cross-references all findings and assigns confidence scores
4. High-confidence findings are posted as inline PR comments with suggestion blocks
5. A summary comment shows consensus findings, unique findings, disputed findings, and per-model comparisons

## Confidence Scoring

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **1.0** | All 3 models independently found this issue |
| **0.8** | 2 of 3 models agree |
| **0.5** | Single model, but synthesizer deems it valid |
| **0.3** | Single model, uncertain validity |
| **< 0.3** | Likely false positive or bias artifact |

Findings with confidence >= 0.66 are posted as inline comments. All findings appear in the summary.

## Setup

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/synergy-reviewer.git
cd synergy-reviewer
npm install
```

### 2. Create a GitHub App

Create a new [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) with:

**Webhook URL**: `https://your-deployment.example.com/api/webhooks`

**Repository permissions**:
- Contents: Read-only
- Issues: Read & write
- Pull requests: Read & write
- Metadata: Read-only

**Subscribe to events**:
- Issue comment
- Pull request review comment

Generate a private key and webhook secret.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Yes | [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key (free models: use IDs ending in `:free`) |
| `OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER` | No | Your app URL; recommended by OpenRouter for free-tier attribution |
| `OPENROUTER_REVIEW_MODELS` | No | Comma-separated OpenRouter model IDs for reviewers. Default: three different free models |
| `OPENROUTER_SYNTH_MODEL` | No | Model ID for the synthesizer. Default: a larger free instruct model |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID` | Yes | Your GitHub App ID |
| `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | Yes | Installation ID for your repo |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | GitHub App private key (with `\n` for newlines) |
| `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | Webhook secret |
| `AGENT_COUNT` | No | Number of parallel agents (1-5). Default: `3` |

Browse [free models on OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/models?q=free) and set `OPENROUTER_REVIEW_MODELS` / `OPENROUTER_SYNTH_MODEL` if defaults change or rate-limit.

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Install the GitHub App

Install the app on your repositories. Mention `@your-bot-name` in any PR comment to trigger a review.
